There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu.\\
The warlord asked the programmer: \\
“Which is easier to design: an accounting package or an operating system?”\\
“An operating system,” replied the programmer.\\
The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.\\ 
“Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating
system,” he said. \\
“Not so,” said the programmer, “when designing an accounting package, the programmer
operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: how it must
operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax laws.
By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside appearances. When
designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between
machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design.”\\ The
warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.\\ “That is all good and well, but which is easier
to debug?”\\ The programmer made no reply.\\}
